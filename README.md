STEHLÍK, Matúš: *Conic relaxations*. Master thesis. Comenius University in Bratislava, Faculty of mathematics, physics and informatics, Department of mathematical analysis and numerical mathematics. Advisor:  RNDr. Mária Trnovská PhD., Bratislava, 2016, 80 pages.


This master's thesis explores the possibility of relaxation of the nonlinear quadratic
optimization problems using the conic programming classes. The thesis offers a
survey of techniques used for constructing conic relaxations.
The aforementioned techniques are applied to the max-cut problem and their performance on several different  instances of this problem is compared.
